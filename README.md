# orphan-tracker-ui

This repo provides the web user interface for https://github.com/etclabscore/go-orphan-tracker.
It is included at that repo as a submodule.

## Features

- Live reload in development
- Webpack
- Sass compilation (and minification/autoprefixing in production)
- ES6+ transpilation (and minification/uglyfication in production)
- ES Modules

## Usage

**Install dependencies**

```
yarn
```

**Run development server**

```
yarn dev
```

Will open your default browser to http://localhost:8080/public

Webpack will watch for changes in the `./src` directory and output the bundled assets to `./public/assets`. In parallel, the development server will watch for changes in the `./public` directory and live reload the browser.

**Build production bundles**

```
yarn build
```

Will compile, minify and autoprefix Sass to CSS. Will Minify and uglify JavaScript and output the bundled assets to `./public/assets`.

After building for production you can take the `./public` directory and deploy it.
